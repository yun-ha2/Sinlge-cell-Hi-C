# scGRAPE: Graph Representation and Anchor Pair Extraction for scHi-C

**scGRAPE** is a graph-based deep learning framework for analyzing single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data.
It reconstructs sparse chromatin contact graphs and predicts higher-order chromatin structures,
including **chromatin loops**, **topologically associating domains (TADs)**, and **A/B compartments**,
using a unified graph representation learning strategy.

This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline from raw scHi-C contact matrices to downstream
3D genome structure inference.
